### Description

This code allows you to easily create shaped forms and buttons. All the complexity is hidden behind the scenes so that ultimately it only takes 1 line of code to make a form, button, or picturebox take on the complex shape of a picture. The code is ready to be plugged right into a project.

An example application is included that is itself pretty cool. It is a little framework for creating "About Screens." The screen shot is an example of what a few lines of code get you.

A second example app allows you to dynamically create shaped forms by selecting a file name. Just good clean fun.

Some of the Win32 API code came from another PSC submission. Don't know who. But thanks !
